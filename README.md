## Backstory
In 2012, Dave Skuza started working at StageBloc as an intern. We had an inside joke where we would fire him for all sorts of things. Committing a broken app build. Showing up to standup 15 seconds late. Making a lame pun. Just because we felt like it. Because we love him. You know... "normal reasons".

It got to a point where his official bio was almost ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been fired more times than I‚Äôve got lines of code written.‚Äù

Over time, firing has become a part of life, especially since Dave no longer works at StageBloc. We love you Dave! Now please sign here.
